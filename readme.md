# Birthdays Gone By

This is a quick little Python automation project that utilizes Selenium webdriver to wish your Facebook friends a happy birthday. The script logs you in to Facebook and comments "Happy Birthday, (friend's name here)!" to whichever Facebook friends have a birthday with the same date that the script was run.

## Level 2 Automation

You can easily ensure you never miss a friend's birthday by running this script on a cronjob.
